Measure fluorescence intensity at the nuclear envelope
======================================================

This example reproduces a well-established workflow in bioimage data analysis
for measuring the fluorescence intensity localized to the nuclear envelope, in
a time sequence of cell images (each with two channels and two spatial
dimensions) which shows a process of protein re-localization from the
cytoplasmic area to the nuclear envelope. This biological application was
first presented by Andrea Boni and collaborators in [1]_; it was used in a
textbook by Kota Miura [2]_ as well as in other works ([3]_, [4]_).
In other words, we port this workflow from ImageJ Macro to Python with
scikit-image.
